# Project-Euler-Problems
This repo contains solutions in multiple languages for problems found on the [project euler site](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Each Problem found in the problems folder will have the following layout:
1. The problem folder itself will be named as the problem in kebab case.
2. README.md: A markdown file containing the description of the problem and a link to it on the project euler site, I may also add some comments about how I went about solving it
3. A solution folder for each language I've solved the problem in. (i.e if I have a solution in Python and PHP, there will be a folder for PHP and Python)
